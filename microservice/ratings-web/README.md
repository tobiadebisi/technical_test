## Prerequisites

To build this sample locally, you can either build using Docker, or using NPM.

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setup

- To build using Docker, in the project folder, run `docker build -t ratings-web .`
- To build using NPM, in the project folder, run `npm install`

## Running the sample

- To run using Docker, run `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 ratings-web`
- To run using NPM, run `npm start`

Required configuration via environment variables:

- API:  `<set to rating-api endpoint>`. The application proxies the API requests via the backend to the rating-api endpoint.

The application exposes port 8080.
You should then be able to access the application at <http://localhost:8080>.
